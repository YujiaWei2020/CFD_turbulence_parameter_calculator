# CFD_turbulence_parameter_calculator


This calculator is made for the calculation on the two equations k-omega SST model parameters default using for sea-water condition (model scale). It will help you to clarify the value of each turbulence parameters and the desired first adjacenent wall thickness for turbulence. 

This calculator has been tested and validated with good results and using in Ocean Engineering paper. 
Hope it frees your one day afternoon searching. 



Run source CPP
type in your characteristic length, for ship generally is the length between perpendiculars. 
type in your flow velocity, for ship generally is the ship forward speeds. for ship moves in waves, this values may varies slightly. 

Dont forget to apply propeller wave function..

Future work pending.
